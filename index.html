            <p>I'm Raphael Mimoun</p>
            <p>I work at the intersection of human rights and technology at <a href="https://wearehorizontal.org" target="_blank">Horizontal</a>, where I oversee the development of tools and provide digital security trainings.</p>
            <p>I'm passionate about building decentralized tools and systems (not just in tech, but in real life too!) that give more agency and autonomy to people and communities. Let's build something <a href="#">together</a>!</p>
            <p>I also occasionally <a href="#">write</a>, mostly about movements and justice.</p>
            <p>I'm from Bordeaux and live in Los Angeles.</p>
